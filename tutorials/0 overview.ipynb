    "\n",
    "The package was designed on the Sklearn philosopy of initialise, plan, act (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html#apis-of-scikit-learn-objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclops contains a number of classes for machine learning interpolation and regression, stored in '*regressors.py*'. These have 3 key methods.\n",
    "* `__init__` where they are initialised with the correct hyperparameters.\n",
    "* `fit` where they are fitted to data.\n",
    "* `predict` where they predict an array of output data values given an array of input data values.\n",
    "The input and output data is always a 2D numpy array of the form `[[x1], [x2], [x3]] or [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3]]`. Not all the regressors can cope with all input data dimensions - the  `CTModel` for instance only applies to 2D input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Field` objects are vector or scalar fields that use the regressors to take in a position in the field and predict the value of the field at that position. They have 3 key methods.\n",
    "* `__init__` where they are initialised with the correct parameters.\n",
    "* `fit_model` where a machine learning model is taught the field data at the known positions in the field so that it can interpolate & extrapolate.\n",
    "* `predict_values` where an array of positions is input and the predictions for the field values at those points are output.\n",
    "The simulation file provided in step 1 is converted to a field object. This is referred to as the 'True field'. Field objects are also used by the `SensorSuite` to predict the field values from sensor values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SensorSuite` objects contain sensors and contain use the sensor data they are given to describe a `Field` that they own. They have many different important methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Experiment` object runs the experiment optimisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all this we analyse the results by plotting plots with the graph manager."
