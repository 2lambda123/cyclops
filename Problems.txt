Problems I faced that are unsolved:


1. None of the points for the GP model of the line temperature field are actually in the 95% confidence range (just put up with this)
2. SciKit model does not cope when we extend the data to the entire face (created function to reduce number of training datapoints)
3. Order of gaussian model is too high
4. Sort out plotting of void space
5. Save the model
6. Pytorch vs numpy problems
