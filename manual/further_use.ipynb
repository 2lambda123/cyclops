    "Modifications (general):\n",
    "1. Add your new simulation file to the simulation folder\n",
    "2. Change the constants in '*src/constants.py*' to describe the boundaries of the 2D grid that we will extract from the simulation file\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifications to '*src/exodus_reader.py*':\n",
    "1. Sample a different variable instead of `temperature` by changing the line in the `__init__()` function\n",
    "2. Use an RBF interpolater instead of a linear interpolator to rearrange your FEM mesh (RBF is much slower for large meshes)\n",
    "3. Write a function that will squash a curved region in your experiment into a 2D grid instead of a 2D region (often a face) into a 2D grid\n",
    "4. Set `double=True` in `generate_side()` to reflect all values in the plane with a normal in the x-axis to pretend that two monoblocks are next to each other\n",
    "5. Rename the columns when saving to a csv\n",
    "6. Add extra columns when saving to a csv\n",
    "7. Change the resolution of the points we save to csv (higher resolutions are more similar to the FEM prediction but take longer to optimise)"
