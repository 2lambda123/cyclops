    "The 'easy_use.ipynb' page of the manual describes (and in fact shows you) how to use the package if you have no idea what you're doing. It gives you control over only a tiny proportion of the capabilities though. This manual describes how to use more of the functionality. It requires more familiarity with the package though. This file contains some ideas for how you can customise the package to your own specific case."

    "Modifications (general):\n",
    "1. Add your new simulation file to the simulation folder\n",
    "2. Change the constants in 'constants.py' to describe the boundaries of the 2D grid that we will extract from the simulation file\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifications to 'exodus_reader.py':\n",
    "1. Sample a different variable instead of 'temperature' by changing the line in the __init__() function\n",
    "2. Use an RBF interpolater instead of a linear interpolator to rearrange your FEM mesh (RBF is much slower for large meshes)\n",
    "3. Write a function that will squash a curved region in your experiment into a 2D grid instead of a 2D region (often a face) into a 2D grid\n",
    "4. Set double=True in generate_side() to reflect all values in the plane with a normal in the x-axis to pretend that two monoblocks are next to each other\n",
    "5. Rename the columns when saving to a csv\n",
    "6. Add extra columns when saving to a csv\n",
    "7. Change the resolution of the points we save to csv (higher resolutions are more similar to the FEM prediction but take longer to optimise)"
