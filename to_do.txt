Presentation
===============
Key for bar charts

Number pareto optimal points and then allow them to be selected and only then produce the pdf.
Results object that stores all data + pickel it or JSON


Physics 
=============
Scalar, vector & tensor classes for reading the exodus (perhaps later) - scipy good for tensors or numpy stk




Geometry
===========
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827121004832 <- unfolding

Deal with various geometries (WITH vtk? - link with defined surfaces)

Make constraints user friendly


Code 
=========
Regression class base classes

Docstrings + tests

Examples + benchmark problems (many simulation files, and many optimsers)

Scalar Regression class -> different models that predict scalar values 
Vector/tensor model consist of many different scalar regression objects (composition not inheritance)

UML diagram for model management

Initialiser (set the hyperparameters), fit (train), predict

Sensor suite class owns an array of many sensor objects
- Owns everything to do with the sensor data




Optimisers
=================
User defined cost functions

Optimisers constaints












Future work
==============
Interpolation for second order FEM meshes using element shape functions
